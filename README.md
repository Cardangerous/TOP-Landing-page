# TOP-Landing-page
Landing page project from The Odin Project. I will build it from scratch and recreate the assigned page.


struggled a bit on making the nav bar learned the importance of inheritance traits on flex items and using the right css code to change things with more detail.

had to play around with the buttons to make sure that only one was outlined white.

having trouble with getting live preview page does not look like my path layout on my desktop.
